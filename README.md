# Paginated json Search Vue.js project <img src="https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png" width="120" height="120">
I decided to create this repository for someone that may want to learn a little about VUE.JS.
The project contains a paginated news feed called from a json file with a search function.
If you have a news.api key, you can use it instead of the json that is being called. Comments are
in the code for a guide.

## Build Setup

I am in the process of converting the code to npm, so for now this is static.
